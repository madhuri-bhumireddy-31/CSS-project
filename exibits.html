                 Sensory soft play areas provide a safe and fun environment for young children to interact and develop essential life skills. Pillows, cushions, bolsters, wedges and tunnels encourage exploration, creativity, motor planning and gross motor abilities.

                    Play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination, dexterity, and physical, cognitive, and emotional strength. Play is important to healthy brain development. It is through play that children at a very early age engage and interact in the world around them.

                    To support learning through a role play area, we have made many fun resources for educators to use when teaching children about a police station,chief kitchen and hospital. This role play area is great to motivate boys in the classroom.
